## About Client

`React Native` will be used to develop iOS, Android and web apps. And `React` will be used to develop Html5 app, which will contain the admin system to add or delete users etc.

### H5 client 
Now you can use this client to add users. Any other apis will need authentication.

To add user, you have to run the `node_modules/.bin/webpack -d` command or just `gulp` command first to generate built pages to run in browsers. After the command, run *built/client/index.html* in any browser.
Click the submit button, a `webuser` with password `123456` will add in mongodb.

**Notice: **For now the user is hard coded for test...
